:greenneutral:So you're telling me-
:greenneutral:That you wanted to start rapping?
:solarhappy:Yeah!
:solarneutral:Figured that I want to kill some time since there's nothing to do around here
:solarneutral:So I "borrowed" this microphone from a blue haired kid
:solarneutral:And repainted it to match my golden colors
:solarhappy:Pretty cool right?
:greenangry:Solar...
:greenneutral:That's technically stealing but I'll let you off the hook for now
:greenneutral:Since you're going to do this rap thing
:greenwink:I'll teach you some of the basics
:greenangry:so you won't embarrass yourself
:solarhappy:Wow, that's rad!
:greenneutral:In these battles you'll have to outmatch your opponent or else they'll do the same to you
:greenneutral:If that happens, you'll choke and then you will lose the game
:solarhappy:Don't worry, I won't let that happen
:greenhappy:Let's see about that when you get into the real deal
:greenneutral:But for now you'll have to follow me and match the rhythm
:solarneutral:Seems simple enough
:greenhappy:One final thing
:greenneutral:There are occasions that you can do a freestyle
:greenneutral:So take that opportunity to recover in battle
:solarhappy:You're saying this like I'm going to have a fist fight with someone
:greenneutral:Well
:greenneutral:Odds are-
:greenwink:Rap battles will end up bloody if things went too far
:solarscared:...
:greenneutral:Don't worry about it
:greenwink:I was just kidding
:solarangry:That was not funny Green!
:greenneutral:Shall we start the practice?
